The transaction set can be used to provide users with a capability to electronically move messages, contracts, explanations, and other one-time communications.\n\nIt is the intent of this transaction set to provide electronic communication (messages) for people, not for computer processing. The use of the transaction set to transmit quasi or unique transaction set standards is discouraged.\n\nThe use of the Text Message transaction set demands of the sender certain detailed information about the recipient. The transaction set's purpose is to provide communication to the recipient in some human-readable form. The recipient's network will dictate what capabilities are available for delivery of the information. It is the responsibility of the sender to obtain this information and include it in the transmission.","name":"Text Message"}
