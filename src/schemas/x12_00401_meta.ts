In certain business environments, the Shipment and Billing Notice permits the consolidation of these two documents into one.\n\nSpecifically, this transaction set is appropriate where the shipment data, when it includes terms and item prices, can be used both to plan receipts and to generate payment. In this environment, the exact prices for the items shipped may not be known in advance by both parties.
